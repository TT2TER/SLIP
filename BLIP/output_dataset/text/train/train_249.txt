Two businessmen are walking along a tiled floor and they see in front of them a large crack in the floor that has people dressed in suits stuck in it. The people are all wide-eyed and shaking. One of the men walking has glasses and his hand in his pocket and doesn't seem surprised while the other man's eyes are bulging in surprise.
