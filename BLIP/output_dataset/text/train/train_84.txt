A man and a woman are living in the zombie apocalypse and surrounded by them. The woman is aiming a shotgun at some of the undead, while the man is wearing an oven mitt and an apron, and offering the ghouls some fresh baked cookies. One of the zombies is already nibbling on a cookie, while another one is selecting one for itself.
