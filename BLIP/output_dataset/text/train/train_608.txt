Inside of an interrogation room in a police department are two cops wearing their badges and guns. They look on, angrily, at a shark who is sitting at a table in the room with a mirror behind it and a lamp hanging over its head. One of the cops is showing the shark a piece of paper. The shark appears to not be upset with the situation it's in.
